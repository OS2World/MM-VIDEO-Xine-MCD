dhahelper is small driver to provide some kernel function into userspace.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Main goal why you need to use that it's busmastering.
(Btw, lacking of possibility to implement convertion of
virtual addresses into physical in userspace caused
implementing of so-called DRM drivers for Linux from
XFree86 side).
Second goal (still is unfinished) - provide possibility
to control port and physical memory access through
groups and access rights of this driver. (Unix way).

Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
just type in this directory:
make all install

If you have compiled this driver first-time then
type also:
make nodes

Porting:
~~~~~~~~
This driver was developed only for Linux.
So if someone will port that on other unicies
then any patches are gladly accepted.

WARNING:
~~~~~~~~
This driver violates some kernel's security rules.
To keep this driver from anonymous access I suggest
you create new group for mplayerxp and /dev/dhahelper
only.

Good luck!
