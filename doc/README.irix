building xine on IRIX
---------------------

* Choose gcc for compilation during configure,
  e.g. 'env CC=gcc ./configure'

* Compile xine with GNU make (gmake).


Known Problems
--------------

* Cannot compile with IRIX cc

  This is an unresolved issue with automake and dependencies.
  Not likely to be fixed soon.

* xine only opens a 16 bit visual and looks ugly

  This is done intentionally (speedup on most architectures).
  Choose an appropriate visual (with xdpyinfo) and select it
  e.g. with 'xine --visual 0x33'.

* Scaling is slow

  Choose the opengl plugin instead of the xshm plugin.
  However, this plugin is still highly experimental, expect
  some crashes, and read README.opengl
