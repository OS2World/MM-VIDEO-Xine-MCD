   <title>General questions about xine and this document</title>

   <sect2 id="about">
    <title>What is the xine engine?</title>
    <para> 
     The xine engine is a free media player engine. It comes in the form of
     a shared libarary and is typically used by media player frontends
     and other multimedia applications for playback of multimedia streams
     such as movies, radio/tv network streams, DVDs, VCDs.
    </para>
    <para>
     Since there are several frontends for the xine library available,
     this document has a problem when it comes to examples.
     The two most common frontends xine-ui and gxine are mixed in command
     line examples throughout this FAQ. When you use a different
     frontend, some of these will not work for you. The filename of
     the config file also varies amongst frontends. If you get confused,
     I recommend you try with one of xine-ui or gxine.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="scope">
    <title>What's the aim and scope of this text?</title>
    <para>
     The primary goal of this FAQ is to cover all recurring questions related
     to the xine engine. Frontend specific questions are usually not covered here.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="wheretogethelp">
    <title>My question is not yet covered here - where can I ask for help?</title>
    <para>
     First of all be sure that your question is really not covered here and
     that you haven't just been a bit too lazy to read through all of this
     text. ;-). Also check out the documentation specific to
     the frontend (e.g. <command>xine-ui</command> or <command>gxine</command> or
     <command>totem</command>).
    </para>
    <para>
     That said - you are welcome to mail to our user mailing list:
     <email>xine-user@lists.sourceforge.net</email>
     Please provide some info about your setup so people have a chance to
     help you, e.g. include information about your audio/video hardware
     and drivers you use, operating system, cpu type and some console
     output/any error messages. Also include command line parameters you
     have specified and information about the type of stream you're
     trying to play back. Also very important is the version of xine
     you're using and information about any additional plugins you
     may have installed on your system.
    </para>
   </sect2>
   
   <sect2 id="pronounce">
    <title>How do I pronounce "xine"?</title>
    <para>
     As long as people know what you are talking about, you are free to
     pronounce it the way you like, but the official pronounciation is
     [ksi:n], like the name "Maxine" with the "Ma" removed.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="modules">
    <title>What are those xine-lib, xine-ui, gxine, ... modules in cvs for?</title>
    <para>
     Some time ago xine just became too complex to be just one big program.
     Therefore it was split into two major parts.
    </para>
    <para>
     xine-lib is simply speaking the engine of xine. It contains all basic plugins
     and is necessary to run anything that relies on xine. (This is the part that
     is covered in this FAQ.)
    </para>
    <para>
     Then there are frontends - applications that use xine. The most
     common frontend is that of a media player. There are currently
     two frontends being developed in the xine project, xine-ui (skinned
     dvd-player style frontend directly based on xlib) and gxine,
     a desktop media-player style frontend using the standard gtk widget set
     and comes with a mozilla browser plugin.
     External projects like kaffeine, sinek and totem develop additional frontends.
     In the future you will likely see more and different types of applications
     being developed which will use the xine engine for video processing
     and other multimedia purposes.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you simply want a media/dvd player, you'll need to install xine-lib
     first and then choose and install a player frontend like xine-ui or gxine.
    </para>
    <para>
     Other modules in CVS are: <filename>xine-plugin</filename> a mozilla browser plugin
     for streaming media playback using xine, 
     <filename>xine-www</filename> the
     xine project website sources.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="cvs">
    <title>Where and how do I get the latest development version?</title>
    <para>
     Be advised that end-users should stick to the official xine releases.
     CVS is only intended for developers and for others who know why they use it.
    </para>
    <para>
     To check out xine-modules from CVS, first do this:
     <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.xine.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xine login</command></screen>
     The password is empty, just press Enter.
    </para>
    <para>
     Then, to check out individual modules (e.g. <filename>xine-lib</filename>, 
     <filename>gxine</filename> or <filename>xine-ui</filename>):
     <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.xine.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xine co &lt;modulename&gt;</command></screen>
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="binaries">
    <title>Where can I find pre-compiled binaries, e.g. RPMs?</title>
    <para>
     The xine project does not provide pre-compiled binaries for legal
     reasons (some parts of xine may be covered by patents in some countries).
     Some OS projects/vendors (e.g. debian, freebsd, ...) offer binaries
     for their distributions - please contact them for further info.
     You can also find links to third parties providing xine RPMs on
     the xine homepage at
     <ulink url="http://xinehq.de/index.php/releases">http://xinehq.de/index.php/releases</ulink>.
    </para>
    <para>
     See the next section of this FAQ for instructions on how to build xine
     from source.
    </para>
   </sect2>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="building">
   <title>Building and installing xine from source</title>

   <sect2 id="buildrequirements">
    <title>What do I need to compile everything properly?</title>
    <para>
     First of all an official and stable release of gcc. Also be aware 
     that patched gcc versions may break parts of xine and are therefore 
     not supported by the xine project.
    </para>
    <para>
     Furthermore you'll have to use GNU make to compile xine. On most GNU/Linux
     systems "make" is GNU make - on other platforms use "gmake" instead.
     Also, zlib is required (including the appropriate header files, which are
     often found in a package called zlib-devel or similar.)
    </para>
    <para>
     If you want to compile xine from CVS, you'll need to have the autobuild tools
     installed (automake, autoconf and libtool - in recent versions).
    </para>
    <para>
     Frontends might need additional libraries, e.g. for gxine you'll need to have
     GTK installed. Make sure you have not only the shared libraries themselves
     but also the header files (often packaged seperately as so-called -dev packages)
     on your system.
    </para>
    <para>
     Some plugins that come with the xine engine need additional libraries (otherwise
     they will not be built). For example, libogg and libvorbis (plus their include files)
     are needed for ogg/vorbis support. Most notably, if you want to see any video
     on your X11 desktop (and that's what you're here for, isn't it?), you need the
     XFree developer packages as well.
    </para>
    <para>
     Don't worry about this too much right now, xine's <command>configure</command>
     (see below) will check for all the stuff needed and will tell you what's missing
     (which means that you should check the output it produces carefully ;) ).
    </para>

    <title>How do I compile xine?</title>
    <sect3 id="simplebuildinstr">
     <title> Simple build instructions for beginners </title>
     <para>
      Download the latest xine-lib and gxine/xine-ui tarballs, then follow
      these instruction. To unpack a tarball, use:
      <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>tar xfvz tarballname.tar.gz</command></screen>
     </para>
     <para>
      The following instructions will install xine in <filename>/usr/local</filename>
      where it will be visible for all users. You need root privileges to do this on most systems.
     </para>
     <para>
      After unpacking xine-lib, issue:
      <screen>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>./configure</command>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>make install</command></screen>
     </para>
     <para>
      Make sure your <filename>/etc/ld.so.conf</filename> contains 
      <filename>/usr/local/lib</filename> and continue with:
      <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>ldconfig</command></screen>
     </para>
     <para>
      Now unpack your frontend (gxine or xine-ui or ...), then:
      <screen>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>./configure</command>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>make install</command></screen>
     </para>
    </sect3>    
    <sect3 id="completebuildinstr">
     <title>Complete build instructions</title>
     <para>
      The build process is the same for all of the xine modules.
     </para>
     <para>
      You have to start with xine-lib. If built and installed successfully, you
      can continue with the frontend(s).
     </para>
     <para>
      If you have installed xine-lib to a non-standard prefix, make sure
      that you have <filename>$prefix/bin</filename> in your PATH and that your linker finds
      libs in <filename>$prefix/lib</filename> - otherwise trying to build modules that
      rely on xine-lib will fail with configure complaining about not
      finding certain parts of libxine. Using bash you can do something like:
      <screen>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>export PATH="$prefix/bin:$PATH"</command>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$prefix/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"</command></screen>
      to make sure libxine can be found by the frontend(s).
     </para>
     <para>
      Last but not least. Here the build instructions. As stated earlier,
      those are the same for every xine module.
      <screen>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>./autogen.sh</command> [-> *only* if you checked your sources out of CVS]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>./configure</command>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>make</command>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>make install</command></screen>
     </para>
    </sect3>    
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="rpmbuild">
    <title>Making your own RPM packages (xine-lib, xine-ui)</title>
    <para>
     Basically you will only have to issue one command, if you have just
     downloaded a source tarball from our web site:
     <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>rpm -ta &lt;THE_NAME_OF_YOUR_SOURCE_TAR_BALL&gt;</command></screen>
    </para>
    <para>
     This will start the binary and source RPM building. After compiling is
     finished, a binary rpm is placed in your rpm binary directory which is
     something like <filename>/usr/src/RPM/RPMS/&lt;YOUR_ARCHITECTURE&gt;</filename>
     and a source RPM is written to your rpm source dir
     (e.g. <filename>/usr/src/RPM/SRPMS</filename>).
    </para>
    <para>
     In case that you have a fresh CVS checkout, you will need to do the
     following first in order to get a tarball release out of it which you
     can later use with the <command>rpm -ta</command> command above:
     <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>./autogen.sh && make clean && make dist</command></screen>
    </para>
    <para>
     In any case, please keep in mind that you have to build and install
     xine-lib first before you can proceed with xine-ui.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="cflags">
    <title>Can I provide additional CFLAGS for compilation?</title>
    <para>
     Yes, you can do so by setting the CFLAGS variable and then running
     <command>configure</command> again. You can even pass them to
     <command>configure</command> directly. Example:
     <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>./configure CFLAGS="-march=i686"</command></screen>
    </para>
    <para>
     Other user variables <command>configure</command> respects are:
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        <command>CC</command> to specify the compiler executable
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        <command>CPP</command> to specify the C preprocessor executable
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        <command>LD</command> to specify the linker executable
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        <command>CPPFLAGS</command> to pass additional include paths or other
        preprocessor options
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        <command>LDFLAGS</command> to pass additional library paths or other
        linker options
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
     An example combining some of these would look like:
     <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>./configure CC="/opt/intel/bin/icc" LD="/opt/intel/bin/xild" CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include/dvdnav" LDFLAGS="-L/home/guenter/xine_libs"</command></screen>

   <sect2 id="athlonflags">
    <title>Are there binaries for my AMD K7 (Athlon&trade;) available? Can I build them?</title>
    <para>
     If you have a recent gcc you can try to compile "more" k7 support in (esp.
     better instruction scheduling). If the configure script should fail to
     detect your processor/gcc correctly, try passing the canonical system name for
     your machine to configure with the <command>--host</command> option, e.g.
     <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>./configure --host=k7-pc-linux-gnu</command></screen>

    <title>Build problems: xine engine (xine-lib)</title>
    <sect3 id="doesntcompile">
     <title>The package doesn't compile at all!</title>
     <para>
      In order to be able to compile xine-lib, you need (amongst other things)
      the zlib compression library plus the appropriate headers, which are
      often found in a package called zlib-devel or similar.
     </para>
     <para>
      Read again carefully the output <command>./configure</command>
      produced and/or compiler warnings and error reports, they often contain
      helpful information to find out what's going on. If you're stuck here
      and decide to post your problem on the xine-user mailing list,
      make sure you include these outputs.
     </para>
    </sect3>
    <sect3 id="xvpluginfailstobuild">
     <title>The Xv video-out plugin fails to compile!</title>
     <para>
      If you want to have Xv support compiled in, make sure you either have
      a shared Xv library on your system, e.g. 
      <command>ls /usr/X11R6/lib/libXv*</command>
      should give you some .so libs, like this:
      <screen>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/X11R6/lib/libXv.a
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/X11R6/lib/libXv.so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/X11R6/lib/libXv.so.1</screen>
     </para>
     <para>
      Alternatively you need to have libtool 1.4 or newer installed, then 
      libXv.a is sufficient. Otherwise you can create the shared versions yourself:
      <screen>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>ld --whole-archive -shared -o libXv.so.1 libXv.a</command>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>ln -s libXv.so.1 libXv.so</command>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>ldconfig</command></screen>
     </para>
     <para>
      Now you should be ready to build the Xv video-out plugin on your system.

    <title>Build problems in frontends (gxine/xine-ui/...)</title>
    <sect3 id="xinelibnotfound">
     <title>I have installed xine-lib but the frontend complains about not finding it!</title>
     <para>
      First of all take a closer look at the compilation instructions above again. 
      You will probably find your answer there right away.
     </para>
     <para>
      As stated there (there again that hint *grin*), make sure that you
      have <filename>$prefix/bin</filename> in your path and that your
      linker is able to find libraries installed in <filename>$prefix/lib</filename>
      By the way, $prefix is where you installed your xine-lib to earlier
      (yes, installing xine-lib with <command>make install</command> would be a good
      idea before trying to compile the frontend ;) ).
     </para>
    </sect3>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="nonrootbuild">
    <title>Can I install xine in my home directory (without being root)?</title>
    <para>
     Sure. First set up a subdir where you install your private software, eg.
     <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>mkdir ~/xine</command></screen>
    </para>
    <para>
     Then you have to set a few environment variables - it's probably a good
     idea to add this to your <filename>~/.bashrc</filename> (or somewhere similar):
     <screen>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>export PATH="$HOME/xine/bin:$PATH"</command>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/xine/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"</command></screen>
    </para>
    <para>
     Now you can unpack tarballs e.g. in <filename>~/xine/src</filename> 
     (<command>mkdir ~/xine/src</command> if necessary) and do a
     <screen>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>./configure --prefix=$HOME/xine</command>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>make install</command></screen>
    </para>
    <para>
     You also need to tell frontends using xine-lib, where to find it:
     <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>./configure --prefix=$HOME/xine --with-xine-prefix=$HOME/xine</command></screen>

    <title>DVD Playback with xine</title>
    <sect3 id="dvdplayback">
     <title>How do I play back DVDs with xine?</title>
     <para>
      Newer xine (1.0.x) releases come with a full-featured
      DVD plugin that should be able to handle any unencrypted,
      non-locked DVD with full menu navigation support. No external
      plugins are required anymore here.
     </para>
     <para>
      To get DVD playback working, first make sure you have
      a symlink <filename>/dev/dvd</filename> pointing to your
      DVD device on your system. For example, if your DVD drive
      is the master ide drive on the second IDE channel,
      <filename>/dev/dvd</filename> should point to
      <filename>/dev/hdc</filename>. Please note that if you
      are using the ide-scsi emulation on your system, it is
      likely that your DVD drive got mapped to a scsi device
      node even though it is an ide drive. In that case first
      check out you boot/kernel logs (or run <command>cdrecord -scanbus</command>)
      to find out which device it got mapped to and set the
      symlink accordingly (should be something like <filename>/dev/scd0</filename>,
      <filename>/dev/scd1</filename>, ... in that case).
      Also make sure you (as a user) have sufficient (read and write) permissions
      on your DVD drive. This could mean you either have to change the device
      permissions or add your user to a special group 
      (e.g. <command>addgroup cdrom username</command>),
      depending on your setup and/or distribution.
     </para>
     <para>
      It is highly recommended to switch DMA mode on for your DVD drive
      (without it even very recent machines will have trouble producing
      smooth video output). Use a command like
      <command>hdparm -d 1 &lt;device&gt;</command>
      on your DVD device. Please note that even if you're using ide-scsi
      you will have to set the dma flag on the ide device node (e.g. 
      <filename>/dev/hdc</filename>), not the mapped <filename>/dev/scd</filename>
      scsi device.
     </para>
     <para>
      To be able to play back encrypted DVDs you need to have
      libdvdcss installed on your system (please check if this is legal where
      you live). If you do not understand what the term "encrypted DVD" means
      here: As a rule of thumb, every DVD you have to pay money for is most
      likely encrypted.
     </para>
     <para>
      To make matters worse, apart from encryption, there is another obstacle
      to take: the region code. The DVD authorities decided to divide the world
      into eight geographical regions. Have a look at
      <ulink url="http://www.dvdforum.gr.jp/RegionMap.pdf">http://www.dvdforum.gr.jp/RegionMap.pdf</ulink>
      if you want to know which number has been assigned to your country. It is
      now their idea, that you shall only play DVDs, which have been produced
      for your region. If you take a DVD off the shelf in your local store,
      you should find a little globe-like icon which shows the region code the
      disc is for.
     </para>
     <para>
      Newer (post-2000) DVD drives (so-called RPC-2 drives) check the DVD
      region, which means they'll prevent you from playing back DVDs that have
      a different region code from what the drive is set up for. Some drives
      come with a factory setting of region 0 so they can play back
      any DVD until a region code is set. Others refuse to play any DVD at all
      until they are told a region. The easiest way to handle this is to use
      the regionset utility from
      <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=31346&amp;release_id=168415">
       http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=31346&amp;release_id=168415
      </ulink>.
     </para>
     <para>
      Once you have everything set up, try something like
      <command>gxine dvd:/</command> or <command>xine -p dvd:/</command>
      to start dvd playback. Some frontend also offer so-called autoplay
      buttons or menu entries that start dvd playback immediately. 
     </para>
     <para>
      Important: do not try to mount the DVD. Just insert it and hit the DVD autoplay
      button or start xine from the command line.
     </para>
     <para>
      If things do not work as expected, try running the <command>xine-check</command>
      shellscript that comes with xine to see if this gives you further hints on
      what could be wrong.

    <title>Can I watch Quicktime (.mov, .mp4) files using xine?</title>
    <para>
     Quicktime is just a system layer (container format) which can contain various 
     different audio and video formats. The system layer itself is fully supported
     in xine. However, some quicktime audio/video codecs are not natively supported yet.
     Luckily, if you are using a x86 compatible machine (any recent PC hardware should do)
     you can install and use the original Quicktime DLLs and watch most streams
     (trailers) that can be downloaded from the net.
    </para>
    <para>
     Possibly the most convenient way to get the Quicktime DLLs is to download
     them from the mplayer website

      http://www1.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/codecs/

     The package is called "QuickTime6 DLLs". Unpack it and move everything you find
     inside to <filename>/usr/lib/win32</filename> (actually you can place them
     anywhere you want, e.g. someplace in your homedirectory, but then you'll
     have to set <parameter>codec.win32_path</parameter> in your
     xine config file accordingly). Restart xine then and you should be

    <title>Real Network files/streams</title>
    <sect3 id="realfileplayback">
     <title>Can I watch Real (.rm, .ram) files using xine?</title>
     <para>
      The situation with real files and streams is pretty similar to the situation
      with Quicktime Streams (see above). The newer real audio and video formats
      are only supported by using binary-only codecs which are available from
      real networks but are not included in xine.
     </para>
     <para>
      One way to get these codecs is to download and install RealPlayer from
      RealNetworks, for example in <filename>/usr/local/RealPlayer8</filename> or
      <filename>/opt/RealPlayer8</filename>. If you installed it in one of these
      places, xine should automatically find and use the real binary codecs.
      If it doesn't work, try to find out the exact path to where the real codecs
      are installed on your system (look for a file named <filename>rv30.so.6.0</filename>
      which should reside in a directory called <filename>Codecs</filename> in the
      directory where you have installed RealPlayer in) and set
      <parameter>codec.real_codecs_path</parameter> in your xine config file
      accordingly.

      xine supports both pnm and rtsp streaming. However, digging out the actual
      pnm/rtsp url can be tricky as they're often packed into heavy JavaScript and
      HTML code on most websites. You can either use a combination of your
      browser's "save source" function and wget or use a xine browser plugin
      (currently the gxine frontend comes with a simple mozilla plugin,
      for example). When you decided to dig out the url by hand don't get fooled
      by the many redirectors that are often placed around the actual url.
      Use wget to download any http://-style urls and use less to look inside
      the downloaded .ra/.ram files where you will find the actual pnm/rtsp
      url which can be opened using xine.

     you'll need to install windows binary codecs (.DLLs).

        Set up and use raw devices for DVD access. Please note that the
        actual performance gain during playback is very small if any, but
        since raw devices are bypassing the kernel's buffer cache, Linux
        will not try to cache the DVDs you play. This would not be useful,
        because xine does its own caching and you usually play DVDs

     Uhm. So you don't like it. Well, there are two things you can do:
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        You can enable xine's audio compressor. Most frontends have
        a settings window and in that you'll find a slider for the
        compressor setting. The values are percent values, so a 
        slider setting of 200 means that xine will double the volume
        of silent parts of the movie (loud parts stay the same).
       </para>
       <para>
        If your frontend does not have such a compression slider,
        you can pass the value with the MRL:
        <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>xine dvd:/#compression:150</command></screen>

        <parameter>codec.a52_dynrng:1</parameter>
        in your xine config file (or use some gui config dialog).

     If this problem only occurs with one specific stream, maybe switching to

     audio on strange channels.
    </para>
    <para>
     If all this doesn't help, maybe you're missing an audio codec or you found
     a bug. If you decide to post your problem on the xine-user mailing list,
     make sure to include all console output xine produced and also clearly

   <sect2 id="surroundsound">
    <title>Can xine produce 4-/5-channel surround audio output?</title>
    <para>
     Yep, it can do that using OSS or ALSA drivers, provided that the driver
     supports it. On startup xine tells you what modes are supported by your
     audio driver, e.g:
     <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;audio_alsa_out : supported modes are mono stereo (4-channel not enabled in xine config) (5-channel not enabled in xine config) (5.1-channel not enabled in xine config) (a/52 and DTS pass-through not enabled in xine config)</screen>
    </para>
    <para>
     On this machine 4-channel surround would be possible. However, since xine
     cannot detect if there are actually speakers connected to the additional
     channels, you'll have to activate that feature manually.
    </para>
    <para>
     You can do this either in the config dialog while xine is running (press
     the config button on the xine panel and go to the AUDIO tab) or have it
     the complicated way by editing the config file yourself which is located
     in your home directory in <filename>.gxine</filename> or <filename>.xine</filename>:

     <title>Retrieving the driver</title>
     <para>
      The OSS driver is maintained by creative and can be downloaded at
      <ulink url="http://opensource.creative.com/">http://opensource.creative.com/</ulink>.
      The driver package contains documentation on how to install it. 
      Besides that I'd like to add the following notes.
     </para>
     <para>
      In order to compile and install these drivers, you need a valid kernel
      configuration file. For RedHat Linux's pre-compiled kernels these
      configuration files can be found in 
      <filename>/usr/src/linux/configs</filename>.
      After you've located the correct config file for your kernel,
      you need to copy it to <filename>/usr/src/linux/.config</filename>
      For example, when you run the 2.4.18-i686 kernel do :
      <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>cp /usr/src/linux/configs/kernel-2.4.18-i686.config /usr/src/linux/.config</command></screen>
      Make sure that the emu10k1 module that is currently installed is 
      not loaded. To unload the modules:
      <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>/sbin/modprobe -rv emu10k1.o ac97_codec.o</command></screen>
      If this mentions that the device is busy, some program is 
      using the driver. Some example could be a mixer application 
      or sound daemon like artsd. You'll need to close down the 
      applications before continuing.
      At success it should print something like:
      <screen>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# delete emu10k1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# delete ac97_codec
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# delete soundcore</screen>
      Run make in the directory where you unpacked the driver and follow the
      instructions printed at the end of each step.
      The last step should be: 
      <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>make install-tools</command></screen>
      As the README of the driver package mentions the SPDIF AC3 
      output doesn't work by default. In the directory 
      <filename>utils/scripts</filename> an <filename>emu10k1.conf</filename>
      file can be found which need to be placed in the default
      installation directory (<filename>/usr/local/etc</filename>). 
      After this the <filename>emu10k1.conf</filename> needs to be modified.
      The following settings worked fine for me (I don't use the analog 
      outputs of the card):
      <programlisting>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CARD_IS_5_1=yes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USE_DIGITAL_OUTPUT=yes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENABLE_TONE_CONTROL=yes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AC3PASSTHROUGH=yes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENABLE_LIVEDRIVE_IR=no
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INVERT_REAR=no
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MULTICHANNEL=yes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ROUTE_ALL_TO_SUB=no
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ANALOG_FRONT_BOOST=no
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SURROUND=no
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROLOGIC=no
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENABLE_CD_Spdif=yes  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENABLE_OPTICAL_SPDIF=no 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENABLE_LINE2_MIC2=no    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENABLE_RCA_SPDIF=no     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENABLE_RCA_AUX=no</programlisting>
      After modifying the <filename>emu10k1.conf</filename>, 
      you need to modify your <filename>/etc/modules.conf</filename> and
      make sure the following lines are in there.
      <programlisting>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alias sound-slot-0 emu10k1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;post-install emu10k1 /usr/local/etc/emu-script</programlisting>
      After saving the changes to <filename>modules.conf</filename>, run 
      <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>/sbin/depmod -a</command></screen>
      Now, you're ready to load the new modules and set the correct 
      options for it. To load the modules run:
      <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>/sbin/modprobe emu10k1</command></screen>

      from user interface or start xine as: 
      <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>xine dvd:/1 -a 0</command></screen>
      The external decoder should display something like 
      "Dolby Digital" in case the selected audio track contains
      AC3 data or "DTS" in case the selected audio track
      contains DTS data. Of course stereo audio also goes
      through the SPDIF output, so the analog outputs of the
      SBLive 5.1 are not needed anymore.

   <sect2 id="volumecontrol">
    <title>Changing the volume with the GUI control has no effect! What's up!?</title>
    <para>
     Some xine drivers do not support volume changing although the GUI
     will show the volume bar. Usually this is not xine's fault: aRts C
     API, for example, doesn't offer any volume property to applications.
     Similarly, with ac3 pass through it is not possible to set the volume.
    </para>
    <para>
     Note that recently we added support to "simulate" volume in aRts by
     changing sample values on-the-fly before delivering them to the driver.
     Not as good as having access to sound card's mixer but at least users 
     will not complain about lacking of volume bar anymore! :)

   <sect2 id="stuttering">
    <title>Audio is stuttering and i see a lot of "metronom: fixing sound card drift by -2115 pts" on the console output</title>
    <para>
     Might be a soundcard problem, if it only comes in longer intervals.
     Your soundcard does not keep it's sampling frequency accurately 
     enough, which results in audio and video
     getting out of sync and xine has to compensate. If you see the message
     only from time to time, you might remedy it by using the resampling sync
     method. You can do this by setting the configuration entry
     <parameter>audio.av_sync_method</parameter> to <parameter>resample</parameter>.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you receive the metronom message more often,
     maybe switching to different drivers (alsa to oss or vise-versa)
     can help here. It has also been reported that setting the configuration
     entry <parameter>audio.force_rate</parameter> to the native sampling
     rate of your soundcard (try 44100 and 48000) helps sometimes.
    </para>
    <para>
     Another, whole different possibility is that you have some background
     process running which is messing with the clock (like some ntp client -
     chronny, ntpd, ...).
    </para>
    <para>
     Occasional messages of "fixing sound card drift" may happen on start and

   <sect2 id="soundloss">
    <title>xine seems to lose sound arbitrarily during playback, especially with DVDs</title>
    <para>
     You are using the OSS audio output plugin, right? In order to keep video and audio
     in sync, xine regularly queries the audio driver for the amount of delay induced by
     the current length of the driver's audio buffer. Unfortunately some OSS drivers seem
     to be broken because the can return strange values here. This confuses the xine audio
     subsystem and makes it drop audio.
    </para>
    <para>
     You should try the various settings of the
     configuration entry <parameter>audio.oss_sync_method</parameter>. The options
     <parameter>getodelay</parameter> and <parameter>getoptr</parameter> ask the driver and
     might therefore show the problem. But chances are that only one is broken and the other
     works, so you should try them both first, since they are the most accurate.
     The option <parameter>probebuffer</parameter> does not ask the driver directly but
     tries to determine the buffer length from outside. This should work with any driver
     and is the way to go, of the driver dependent methods fail.
     <parameter>softsync</parameter> is the least accurate and should be used only in
     emergency situations.

   <sect2 id="discardedskipped">
    <title>What is the difference between discarded and skipped frames?</title>
    <para>
     Sometimes xine will output a message like that:
     <programlisting>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200 frames delivered, XX frames skipped, YY frames discarded</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
     The difference between these counters is a little subtle for the non
     developer. There are two threads running in order to display video:
     the decoder thread will deliver frames to the video output thread. 
     The later is responsible for scheduling the frames to be displayed at
     the right time.
    </para>
    <para>
     If your system can't keep up with decoding requirements, decoder will
     deliver overdue frames. Imagine if it finished decoding the frame
     tagged for displaying at 11:30 but xine clock marks 11:31. When this
     situation is detected, xine will try to skip decoding a few frames
     to recover. Not every decoder may support this feature.
    </para>
    <para>
     When the frame is decoded to be shown somewhere in future but the
     output thread doesn't get scheduled in time by the operating system
     to complete the operation, the frame is discarded. One cause might
     be the disk access operation, which may halt the system for a few
     miliseconds without DMA. See performance section tips above.
    </para>

     Note that if a decoder can't skip frames for some reason, you would
     never see frames skipped (they would be all discarded).

   <sect2 id="contrastbrightnesssaturation">

     This frequently happens with new Xv drivers or when switching to a

     use different ranges for the contrast/brightness/saturation settings.
    </para>
    <para>
     To fix this, try opening the xine settings window and try adjusting
     the sliders for contrast, brightness and saturation.
    </para>

     Please note that some frontends save these settings in their config file
     so when you have found a working combination, make sure you exit 
     xine cleanly so the values are saved.

   <sect2 id="videodriver">
    <title>Which is the best video driver to use?</title>
    <para>
     xine support several video drivers for outputing the image. These will
     differ on how the frames are copied to the video card memory, whether
     colorspace conversion and scaling is done in software or hardware, among
     other things. They may also differ on ease of use and stability.
    </para>
    <para>
     Most of the time, Xv should give the users a good trade-off between
     quality, compatibility and ease of use. This is why xine tries to use
     Xv by default.

     However some users may want to explore better the available hardware 
     capabilities (eg. syncing frame drawing with monitor refresh).
     Also some Xv drivers contain slow copies and accessing the video card
     directly may yield performance gains.
    </para>
    <para>
     Drivers that access hardware directly includes VIDIX (warning: requires 
     root priviledges or kernel helper) and SyncFB (requires kernel helper - Matrox only).
     User may try one of those, but should be warned that with root access
     they can cause the system to crash hard. The support is also limited to
     a couple of graphics cards only.
    </para>
    <para>
     Graphic workstations like SGI have usually a good support for OpenGL.
     In that case, using OpenGL may be a better choice than XShm. However for
     most desktop systems the performance of OpenGL will be quite bad.

     You can select the audio driver using the -A option. So try:
     <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>xine -A null</command></screen>
     If you have ALSA drivers installed, try:
     <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>xine -A alsa</command></screen>
     If you run ESD (not recommended), try:
     <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>xine -A esd</command></screen>
     If you run artsd, try:
     <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>xine -A arts</command></screen>

    <title>"no video port found"</title>
    <para>
     You got the Xv extension, but your video card driver doesn't support it.
     First try to find a driver that does support Xv on your hardware (check
     your graphics card vendor). If your driver has Xv support but you can't
     get it working, try at a lower resolution (1024x768 is enough even for
     anamorphic DVDs).
    </para>
    <para>
     If all that fails, you can still use plain X11/XShm:

     You probably don't have /dev/dvd (check that). If so, simply create a
     link /dev/dvd that points to your DVD device. Something like...
     <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>ln -s hdc /dev/dvd</command></screen>
     ...should do the job. Also make sure you have read and write access on
     the device the symlink points to.

     Probably xine can't access your input source. Most commonly this happens
     when you're trying to play locked/encrypted DVDs. Remember that xine
     can't play such DVDs out-of-the box for legal reasons (see above).
    </para>
    <para>
     If it is legal where you live, you can try to install libdvdcss. Once
     you have done that and re-start xine, it should automatically detect
     and use it to play back encrypted DVDs.
    </para>
    <para>
     Another reason could be that your (RPC-2) DVD drive isn't set up
     for the right region (see above).
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="ossfailed">
    <title>"audio driver 'oss' failed, using null driver instead"</title>
    <para>
     First of all, make sure that your OSS Audio drivers are working (i.e.
     you can play music with other software). Maybe you're using alsa?
     If so, try <command>gxine -A alsa</command> to see if this helps.
    </para>
    <para>
     The most common reason for oss not working is that some other program is accesing
     your audio device. If you're using linux, the command <command>fuser /dev/dsp</command>
     should give you the PID of the process.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you are using GNOME, chances are that this is caused by ESD. Now you
     have two possibilities. Either deactivate ESD (temporarily) by right
     clicking on the sound monitor applet and selecting "Place Esound in
     standby" or just kill it. Then xine will use OSS audio output. The other
     method is to make xine use ESD for audio output with:      
     <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>gxine -A esd</command></screen>
     This may result in worse playback - exact syncronization is not possible
     with esd, so using oss should be preferred.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you are using KDE, there is the possibility that the aRts sound
     daemon is currently running and thus blocking your sound device. You
     can check that by starting the aRts control (in your KDE menu it should
     be under Multimedia). If it is running, you can either use the aRts
     audio output plugin:
     <screen>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<command>gxine -A arts</command></screen>
     Or you suspend the aRts daemon by checking the appropriate option in
     your aRts control. (recommended)
    </para>
    <para>
     Newer versions of arts have an auto-suspend mode - this can lead to
     some nondeterministic behaviour of xine if it is set up to use
     the audio device directly. Using arts is recommended in that case,
     however you will loose the ability to do four/five channel audio output.

     This is a performance related problem.
     If you have a fast computer and this message shows from time to

     OK, yes, that shouldn't happen and you're upset. We can understand that.
     But, to help you and of course to fix this, we need some information.
     So, let's go through the checklist and maybe prepare a nice bug report
     for the xine-user mailing list:
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        Did xine really crash (segfault) or did it hang (deadlock)?
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        Can you reproduce the bug? (e.g. do you remember what you
        did and when you do it again it crashes again?) 
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        Is that a specific media file or format which crashes xine? (Have you
        tried other files types?)
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        Check the console output (and include it in a bug report), maybe earlier
        there is some output that points to the problem.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        Your X server just froze on you? unfortunately that's a known problem
        with some chipsets and drivers (most commonly Savage chipsets) when
        using Xv. You might want to try running <command>gxine -V XShm</command>
        to see if the problem is related to the Xv driver. This will unfortunately 
        be much slower, as lots of things are now done in software instead of
        hardware scaling/colour space conversion.
       </para>
       <para>
        Maybe at the time you read this, there's an XFree upgrade which fixes
        this for the Savage driver. If that works for you, please notify the xine crew at
        <email>xine-user@lists.sourceforge.net</email>, so they can update this FAQ!
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        Even though we try to make each release as bug free as possible, xine is
        still under heavy development (nice excuse, isn't it? *grin*).
       </para>
       <para>
        If you write to the xine user mailing list 
        <email>xine-user@lists.sourceforge.net</email>
        make sure you include a the above information (when applicable)
        and also some information about your machine (operating system, cpu type and
        speed, gfx card, sound card, ...) and please use a meaningfull subject
        line ("xine bug" is bad, "xine fails to play this quicktime trailer in fullscreen mode"
        ist much better).
       </para>
       <para>
        Thanks for taking the time to help improve xine.
