                           -------------------------
                           xine engine configuration
                           -------------------------

These settings may be found on ~/.xine/config or ~/.gxine/config, depending on 
which frontend you're using. The config file itself contains comments documenting
the config options as well so this might be an additional source of information.

Some frontends (like xine-ui and gxine) also have nice graphical config dialogs
which may be more convenient to use than editing the config file by hand. This
also means that it is a bad idea to edit the config file while a xine frontend
is running.

Some settings on setup dialog will require xine to be restarted to take effect.



Audio driver specific values:
-----------------------------

audio.alsa_default_device       Device name used for mono.
                                (e.g. default)

audio.alsa_mmap_enable          Enable mmap mode. 0 = Old mode, 1 = mmap mode.

audio.driver                    audio driver to use, same as xine-ui's command line
                                option -A

                                value for systems with braindead audio drivers that
                                don't properly communicate back what audio rates they
                                do support.  The default value of 0 attempts to
                                automatically detect the optimum audio output rate
                                (e.g. use 44100 to force 44.1 KHz audio)

audio.resample_mode             Adjust whether resampling is done or not.

                                use this to manually adjust a/v sync

                                     video synchronization, with the
                                     preference order being GETODELAY,
                                     GETOPTR, and finally SOFTSYNC
                        getodelay:   Try to force use of the
                                     SNDCTL_DSP_GETODELAY ioctl
                                     to achieve true audio/video
                                     synchronization, even if the
                                     audio driver doesn't claim
                                     to support real-time
                        getoptr:     Try to force use of the
                                     SNDCTL_DSP_GETOPTR ioctl
                                     to achieve true audio/video
                                     synchronization, even if the
                                     system supports the preferred
                                     SNDCTL_DSP_GETODELAY ioctl
                        softsync:    Force use of the system real-time
                                     clock for audio softsync with
                                     the video, even if the audio
                                     driver actually has support for
                                     real-time - there may be audio/
                                     video synchronization issues
                                     with use of this setting
                        probebuffer: Probe sound card buffer size on
                                     initialization to calculate the
                                     audio latency for a/v sync.
                                     Try this if your system doesn't
                                     support the real-time ioctl's
                                     and you experienced sync errors
                                     after long playbacks.

audio.oss_device_num            -1, 0-16: Forces the OSS plugin to use the specified
                                dspX device, regardless of its capabilities.
                                If -1 (default) is specified, the audio device with
                                the best capabilities will be used.
                                Note: /dev/dsp is usually a symlink to /dev/dsp0

audio.oss_latency               For softsync you can manually adjust the default
                                a/v sync latency here. The units are in miliseconds,
                                so if the sound seems delayed 1 second from the video
                                set it to 1000. (default value = 0)

audio.passthrough_offset        the audio offset for passthrough output.
                                The unit is PTS (1/90000s), defaults to 0.

audio.sun_static_delay          sun driver static delay (latency)

misc.demux_strategy             0..3: Demuxer detection strategy. 
                                (see xine.h for details about values).

misc.memcpy_method              Memcopy method to use in xine for large data chunks.
                                Will be probed on first xine run. possible values:

video driver specific values:
-----------------------------

video.deinterlace_method    method to use for software-deinterlacing (currently
                            only supported on Xv driver):
                     0 none
                     1 bob: if movement is detected on interlaced lines
                       interpolate the pixels. lose resolution only on
                       moving pixels but should avoid zig-zag effects.
                     2 weave: similar to bob with a tendency to preserve
                       original image (less interpolation). must be
                       good for high detail on low-movement scenes,
                       but usually has bad output.
                     3 greedy: take either the older or newer weave pixel
                       depending upon which give the smaller comb factor,
                       and then clip to avoid large damage when wrong.
                       very good results for low or intermediate motion.
                     4 onefield: always interpolate lines, not matter they
                       are static or moving. always lose resolution.
                     5 onefieldxv: the same as onefield except we deliver
                       half of the lines to Xvideo driver and let it scale
                       for us. very low cpu usage. not all cards implement
                       bilinear scaling (interpolation) so this may be
                       the worst quality method, but it's the only that
                       don't require MMX.
                     6 linearblend: does a kind of vertical blurring over
                       the image to remove interlace artifacts. simple but
                       reported to produce good results.


video.syncfb_device             Path to the syncfb device (default: /dev/syncfb)
                     
video.syncfb_default_repeat     Specifies how many times a frame is repeated.
                                Defaults to 3.
                                (note: hardware deinterlacing will always use 1)

video.driver                    video driver to use, same as command line 
                                option -V
                                (e.g. aa, Syncfb, XShm, Xv)

video.xshm_gamma                gamma correction for XShm driver (-100..100)
                                note: in fact, it may be referred as brightness

video.disable_scaling           some drivers (like XShm) do image scaling by
                                software. disabling it will greatly improve 
                                playback performance, but the video will never
                                be scaled to fit window size.

*** NOTE: not all XV attributes are available for every video card/driver
      
video.XV_COLORKEY               -1000..1000: X11 XVideo COLORKEY property value.
                                colorkey to use, may be usefull to change
                                if parts of your desktop become transparent

video.XV_BRIGHTNESS             -1000..1000: X11 XVideo BRIGHTNESS property value.

video.XV_CONTRAST               -1000..1000: X11 XVideo CONTRAST property value.

video.XV_SATURATION             -1000..1000: X11 XVideo SATURATION property value.

video.XV_HUE                    -1000..1000: X11 XVideo HUE property value.

video.XV_FILTER                 Enable bilinear scaling mode on Permedia cards
                                (may impact on performance)
                                            0 = no filter
                                Permedia 2: 1 = enabled
                                Permedia 3: 1 = partial (x direction); 2 = full
                                No other cards seem to support this. 

video.XV_DOUBLE_BUFFER          Enable double buffering to sync video on
                                monitor retrace. At least nvidia drivers
                                should support this.

video.num_buffers               Number of video buffers (8k each) xine
				allocates. Higher values (e.g. 2500)
				might lead to smoother playback on some
				dvd drives while increasing latency
				for multiangle playback.
